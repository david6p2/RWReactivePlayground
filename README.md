Learning ReactiveCocoa with https://www.raywenderlich.com/62699/reactivecocoa-tutorial-pt1

I follow the ReactiveCocoa Tutorial to learn about it and understand how it could be used in MVVM. It's nice how you can get rid of IBActions, and how to manage async API calls.

## Instructions

Just clone and run. If you have any trouble, regenerate the pods by doing a 

    pods install
    
in your terminal.

Make sure you have installed Cocoapods.
